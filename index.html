<h1>Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Spock </h1>
<p>"Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" is an expanded version of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors". The game was popularized by the TV show "The Big Bang Theory" and was created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla.</p>
<p> The game is played between two players who simultaneously reveal one of five hand gestures:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rock (represented by a closed fist)</li>
    <li>Paper (represented by an open hand)
    </li>
    <li>Scissors (represented by a fist with the index and middle finger extended)</li>
    <li>Lizard (represented by a hand with the thumb and pinky extended)</li>
    <li>Spock (represented by a hand with the middle and ring finger extended)</li>
</ul>
    <p>The rules for winning in "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Rock crushes Scissors and crushes Lizard
    </li>
    <li>
        Paper covers Rock and disproves Spock
    </li>
    <li>
        Scissors cuts Paper and decapitates Lizard
    </li>
    <li>
        Lizard poisons Spock and eats Paper
    </li>
    <li>
        Spock smashes Scissors and vaporizes Rock
